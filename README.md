# Motivational Quotes

File 'quotes.txt' contains around 163 quotes, scrapped from 2 different websites listed in py scripts 'quote_scrape_1.py' and 'quote_scrape_2.py'. 

Main file execution is within 'random_quote_of_the_day.py'.

Future Plans:
-
1. Scrap data from websites that contains javascript widgets
2. Make a website/ chrome widget with scheduled pop-ups throughout the day
3. Increase quotes dataset



My favourite quote of all time: 


"It's the constant and determined effort that breaks down all resistance, sweeps away all obstacles. - CLAUDE M. BRISTON"
